# Community Diep!

This is a version of the popular browser game diep.io that was created by the community in /r/diepio. In addition to myself, massive credit goes to:

- [/u/Koulatko](https://www.reddit.com/u/Koulatko) for the graphics 

- [/u/haykam821](https://www.reddit.com/u/haykam821) for back and front end dev work 

The game is still being worked on, but not as actively as before due to prolonged downtime and other distractions. As of now, it is fully functional and can be tested out at https://cdiep-nylr.c9users.io/index.html. The game implements many features not found in the real version, including live chat and frequently spawning green shapes. In the coming months we hope to add stat upgrades as well as a complete tank tree.
